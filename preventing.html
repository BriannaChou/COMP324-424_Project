<title>Browser Hardening</title>
<h1>Browser Hardening</h1>
<p><cite>"Hardening is a process whereby a computer is made more resistant to cyber intrusion from malicious attack and from accidental infection.</cite> <a href="https://www.controleng.com/articles/six-steps-to-improve-computer-hardening/">[link]</a>"  This is a great definition of what hardening is.
    However the goals for this website are for hardening a browser to make it more private, which would allow it to be more secure.

<h1>Recommendations for Firefox Hardening</h1>
<h2>General Section:</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Uncheck <b>Restore previous session</b></dt>
    <dd>- If you use a VPN and your connection goes down, then when Firefox loads up again, the website can potentially know your IP if you restore the page and are not using the VPN.</dd>
</dl> 
<h2>Home Section:</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Set <b>Homepage and new windows</b> to <b>Blank Page</b></dt>
    <dd>- one less connection when you boot up the browser</dd>
    <dt>Set <b>New Tab</b> to <b>Blank Page</b></dt>
    <dd>- These will prevent Firefox from spawning their own sites when you need a new page/tab.</dd>
    <dt>Uncheck everything under <b>Firefox Home Content</b> (Shortcuts, Recommended by Pocket, Recent activity, Snippets)</dt>
    <dd>- This will prevent Firefox from loading their own content</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Search Section</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Change <b>Default Search Engine</b> to <b>DuckDuckGo</b></dt>
    <dd>- DuckDuckGo is one of the more privacy-centric browsers (searx is a good alternative as well)</dd>
    <dt>Uncheck <b>Provide Suggestions</b></dt>
    <dd>- Prevents the queries from going to the Google API</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Under <b>Cookies and Site Data</b>, check <b>Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed</b></dt>
    <dd>- next time the you visit the same website, the website will not be able to read the previous sessions cookies, since there none.</dd>
