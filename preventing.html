<h1>Browser Hardening</h1>
<p><cite>"Hardening is a process whereby a computer is made more resistant to cyber intrusion from malicious attack and from accidental infection.</cite> <a href="https://www.controleng.com/articles/six-steps-to-improve-computer-hardening/">[link]</a>"  This is a great definition of what hardening is.
